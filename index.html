            Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family
            Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including
            the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the red deer, and the fallow deer;
            and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), white-tailed
            deer, the roe deer, and the moose. Male deer of all species (except
            the water deer) as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new
            antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned
            antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the
            same order of even-toed ungulates
