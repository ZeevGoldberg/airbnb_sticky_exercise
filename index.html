            Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family
            Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including
            the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the red deer, and the fallow deer;
            and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), white-tailed
            deer, the roe deer, and the moose. Male deer of all species (except
            the water deer) as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new
            antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned
            antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the
            same order of even-toed ungulates

        Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the
        western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and
        extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S.
        Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed
        into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was
        the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the
        first national park in the world.The park is known for its wildlife and
        its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of
        its most popular.While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine
        forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies
        forests ecoregion.
